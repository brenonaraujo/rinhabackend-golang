# Project Backlog

## Setup and Configuration
- [ ] **Initialize Go Module**: Set up the Go project structure with modules for better dependency management.
- [ ] **Database Selection and Integration**: Choose a performant database, integrate with Go using an ORM or direct SQL, considering consistency and performance for operations.

## API Development
- [ ] **Define Data Models**: Create structs in Go corresponding to the database models, focusing on efficient data access patterns.
- [ ] **Implement CRUD Operations**: Develop the necessary API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data, ensuring to optimize for performance and consistency.
- [ ] **Business Logic Implementation**: Code the business rules as defined in the challenge, ensuring they are efficiently handled in the Go application.

## Quality Assurance
- [ ] **Unit Testing**: Write tests for individual units/components to ensure reliability.
- [ ] **Integration Testing**: Test the integration of different parts of the application to ensure they work together as expected.

## Performance Optimization
- [ ] **Profiling and Optimization**: Use Go's profiling tools to identify bottlenecks and optimize them.
- [ ] **Concurrency Management**: Leverage Go's concurrency model (goroutines and channels) to improve performance, especially in IO-bound operations.

## Documentation and Deployment
- [ ] **API Documentation**: Document the API endpoints, request/response formats, and any other relevant information.
- [ ] **Deployment Preparation**: Containerize the application with Docker for consistent deployment and scalability.

## Monitoring and Maintenance
- [ ] **Logging**: Implement structured logging for monitoring and debugging purposes.
- [ ] **Performance Monitoring**: Integrate performance monitoring tools to continuously track application performance.

Remember to prioritize tasks based on dependencies, with initial setup tasks first, followed by core development, and finally optimization and documentation.
